## What’s the one thing I bring to this career?
i can adabt with any suden changes .

## What are the things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself?
For me its like a Scenario each Scene must be prepared well ,so lets divide problem solving into phases like this:

Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 

Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

Research and Caveat.
