Q1:Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In other words, it's a way of estimating how a change in one variable affects the other variable(s).

The basic concept behind linear regression is to find the best-fit line that summarizes the relationship between the variables. This line can then be used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable(s).
Q2: Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

- Import the necessary libraries
- Load the data
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Create an instance of the LinearRegression class
- Fit the model to the training data
- Make predictions on the test data
- Evaluate the model's performance

Q3:What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?
By comparing the model's predictions to the actual outcomes on the testing set, we can determine how well the model is performing and whether it is overfitting or underfitting. This information can then be used to tune the model's hyperparameters and improve its performance.
