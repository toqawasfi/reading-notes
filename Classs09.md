Q2: the main ethical issue raised was the unauthorized use of open-source software without giving credit or compensation to the original developers. The speaker highlighted the importance of giving credit and acknowledging the work of others in the open-source community.

To avoid this issue, developers can use open-source licenses that explicitly define the terms and conditions for the use and distribution of their code. By choosing a license and adhering to its terms, developers can ensure that their work is used in an ethical and legal way. Additionally, it is important to establish a culture of respect and recognition within the development community, where giving credit and acknowledging the work of others is seen as a standard practice.

Q3: The Python statistics module is a built-in module that provides a set of functions for statistical calculations. The module contains functions for performing common statistical operations, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.

One example of a function within the statistics module is the mean() function, which calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers. Here's an example of how to use the mean() function

EX:
import statistics

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = statistics.mean(data)

print(mean)  # Output: 3
