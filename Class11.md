Q1: upyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It allows users to arrange their workspaces with notebooks, code editors, terminals, and outputs in a more flexible and powerful way than Jupyter Notebook. Some key features and benefits of JupyterLab include:

Multiple Document Interface (MDI): JupyterLab supports multiple tabs and panels, which can be arranged as per user's need. This feature provides users with more flexibility in working with multiple notebooks and other files.

Integrated Terminal: JupyterLab provides an integrated terminal for running system commands, shells, or scripts. This eliminates the need for opening an external terminal window or command prompt.

Drag and Drop: JupyterLab supports drag-and-drop functionality that allows users to drag files or tabs from one panel to another.

Code Console: A code console in JupyterLab is available for testing code snippets or running a script on a small subset of data. It is a lightweight environment that is ideal for testing code.


Support for Multiple Languages: JupyterLab supports multiple programming languages such as Python, R, Julia, and more.

Jupyter Notebook, on the other hand, provides an interactive computing environment for Python, R, and other languages. It is a web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. Some key differences between JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook are:

User Interface: JupyterLab provides a more flexible and customizable user interface than Jupyter Notebook. The UI of Jupyter Notebook is more rigid and doesn't support features like dragging and dropping tabs and panels.


Multiple Notebooks: JupyterLab provides users with the ability to work on multiple notebooks at once, while Jupyter Notebook only allows users to work on one notebook at a time.

Overall, JupyterLab provides a more flexible and powerful environment than Jupyter Notebook, making it ideal for more advanced users and those working on complex projects.

Q2:Some of the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library include:

Multi-dimensional arrays: NumPy provides a powerful N-dimensional array object that allows you to work with arrays of any dimensionality. These arrays are much more efficient than Python's built-in lists, especially for large datasets.

Mathematical functions: NumPy provides a range of mathematical functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions. It also includes linear algebra functions such as dot product, matrix multiplication, and matrix inversion.

Array indexing and slicing: NumPy allows you to index and slice arrays using intuitive and powerful syntax. This makes it easy to extract and manipulate data from multi-dimensional arrays.

Q3:NumPy arrays are a fundamental data structure used in scientific computing and data analysis with Python. They are similar to Python lists, but have several advantages, such as better performance, more efficient memory usage, and a wide range of built-in functions and operations.

The basic structure of a NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same data type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. The dimensions of an array are called its "axes", and the number of axes is called the "rank". For example, a 1-D array (vector) has a rank of 1, a 2-D array (matrix) has a rank of 2, and so on. Each element of an array is accessed by an index tuple, where each index corresponds to the position of an element along a particular axis.


EX: import numpy as np

# create a 1-D array from a list
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# create a 2-D array from a nested list
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# create a 3-D array from a nested list of nested lists
c = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

# create a 1-D array of zeros
d = np.zeros(5)

# create a 2-D array of ones
e = np.ones((3, 4))

# create a 3-D array of random values between 0 and 1
f = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4)
