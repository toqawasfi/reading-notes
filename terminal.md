## CLI summrisation:
The command line is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. It allows users to execute commands by typing in text commands into a terminal or console window, rather than using a graphical user interface (GUI).

## How does it work ?

The command line interface typically has a prompt, which is a text indicator that shows where the user can type commands. The prompt may also display information such as the current working directory, the user's username, and the hostname of the computer.

When the user types a command, the terminal or console window sends that command to the shell, which is a program that interprets and executes commands in the operating system. The shell reads the command and its parameters and then executes the corresponding program or system function.

## How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories ?
Making a file: The touch command can be used to create an empty file. For example, to create a file named "example.txt", type:

touch example.txt

Making a directory: The mkdir command can be used to create a new directory. For example, to create a directory named "my_folder", type:

mkdir my_folder

Removing a file: The rm command can be used to remove a file. For example, to remove a file named "example.txt", type:

rm example.txt

Note that this command will permanently delete the file, so be careful when using it.
