Q1:Pandas is one of the most libraries in python used mainly for  data analysis and preprocessing ,provides special datastructures to deal with structured data.The two primary data structures in Pandas are the Series and the DataFrame.

Q2:The two primary data structures in Pandas are Series and DataFrame.
Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.).

DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks, such as data cleaning, data manipulation, data transformation, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

In general, Series is useful for working with one-dimensional data, such as time-series data, whereas DataFrame is better suited for working with tabular data, such as data in a spreadsheet or database. 

Q3:o load a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, you first need to have the dataset in a file format that Pandas can read. Some common file formats that can be used include CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON.

Once you have your dataset in one of these formats, you can use a Pandas function to read the data into a DataFrame. The function to use will depend on the format of the data.

For CSV files, you can use the read_csv() function, which allows you to specify options
