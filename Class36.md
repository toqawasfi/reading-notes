## Question one:
Three key features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript (ES5) are:

a. let and const Declarations:

The let and const keywords provide block-scoped variable declarations, replacing the traditional var keyword, which had function-level scope. let allows variables to be reassigned, while const declares constants that cannot be reassigned. This improves code clarity, reduces accidental variable reassignments, and helps in preventing unintended side effects.
b. Arrow Functions:

Arrow functions offer a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a lexical this binding, which simplifies the handling of this context. Arrow functions do not create their own this, so they are especially useful in callbacks, reducing the need for additional workarounds like .bind() or self = this.
c. Destructuring Assignment:

Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into distinct variables. It provides a more concise way of extracting data, making code cleaner and more readable. This feature is particularly useful when working with complex data structures.

## Question 2:
The purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS is to offer small, single-purpose utility classes that can be easily combined to style HTML elements. These utility classes provide a modular and low-level approach to styling, allowing developers to apply styles quickly without writing custom CSS. They follow a naming convention that describes their functionality, making it easy to understand their purpose.

Example of using utility classes in Tailwind CSS to style an HTML element:


<!-- HTML element -->
<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p class="text-white">This is a styled element using Tailwind CSS utility classes.</p>
</div>

## Question Three: 
The main advantages of using Next.js for web development are:

a. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG):

Next.js supports SSR, which means that pages can be rendered on the server before sending them to the client. This improves initial page load performance and SEO, as search engines can index fully-rendered pages. Additionally, Next.js provides SSG, enabling developers to pre-render static pages at build time, further enhancing performance and reducing server load.
b. Automatic Code Splitting:

Next.js automatically performs code splitting, creating smaller bundles for each page and loading only the required JavaScript for each page. This leads to faster page loads and better overall performance, especially for larger applications..
