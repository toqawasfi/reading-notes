## What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model? 
Flexibility: With a Custom User Model, you have the flexibility to define your own fields and behavior for the user model. You can customize the user model to fit the specific requirements of your application, such as adding additional fields or removing unnecessary fields.

Extensibility: By using a Custom User Model, you can easily extend the user model with new fields, methods, and relationships. This allows you to incorporate additional user-related functionality into your application without the need for complex workarounds or separate profile models.

Data Integrity: Using a Custom User Model enables you to have control over the database schema and data associated with user accounts. You can ensure data integrity by defining field constraints, validations, and unique constraints on user fields.

## Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.

## What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.
DjangoX is an open-source Django starter framework that extends the functionality of Django by providing additional features, boilerplate code, and best practices to kickstart Django projects. It aims to streamline the development process and provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable Django applications.

By using DjangoX, you get a preconfigured user authentication system, including login, logout, password reset, and user profile functionality. You can easily customize and extend these features to fit your project's requirements. DjangoX provides the necessary templates, views, and models, so you can focus on building your application's unique features rather than spending time on repetitive setup tasks.
