Q3:
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. In Python applications, APIs can be used to access and manipulate data from external sources. This is achieved by sending HTTP requests to API endpoints, receiving and parsing the API responses, handling authentication and authorization, manipulating the data, and handling errors and rate limiting. Python libraries and tools provide support for working with APIs, making it easy to integrate external services and access the desired data. By utilizing APIs, Python applications can leverage the functionality and data offered by external services, enabling seamless integration and automation.

Q4:
The Requests library in Python is a popular third-party library that simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling the corresponding responses. It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for interacting with APIs and other web services.

    command uses:
     pip install requests
The Requests library in Python simplifies the process of interacting with APIs by allowing developers to send HTTP requests and handle the corresponding responses. By importing the library and using the get() function, developers can send a GET request to the API endpoint and retrieve the response. Checking the status code ensures the success of the request, and accessing the response content using the json() method allows for further processing and utilization of the data. Error handling can be implemented for unsuccessful requests. The Requests library provides additional features for customizing requests, such as adding headers, passing parameters, and handling authentication, offering flexibility in API integration.
