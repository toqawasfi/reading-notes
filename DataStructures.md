Why its important? Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
Time and Space complexity.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack? 
Assigning Base Case.
