# What is a linked list?
A linear data structure algorithem represents a sequence of nodes connected with each other , each node has value and pointer points to the next node adress.Each linked list has to main parts head and current nodes,so head is the first node and the current is where are you now and the tail which is the last element.

# Why Linked list?
Actually , each dataset has its own charactristic so needs data structure withe fitted specifications ,all most linked list used in a way we have data distributed in randome addresses in the memory. in a such way linked list provides low space complexity and some how low time complexity.


# HOW Linked list works?
Lets start our talking about inserting ,so to insert element into linked list you should go to the previous node and make its pointer references to your new node adress in the memory as well.

About delete its simple as you would to elemenate its adress from your list so make the pointer points at other adress.

Searching: The linked list can be searched for a specific value by traversing the list and comparing the values of each node with the target value.
