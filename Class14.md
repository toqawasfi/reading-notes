Question 1:

Matplotlib:

Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that provides a low-level interface for creating a wide range of static, interactive, and animated plots.
It offers fine-grained control over plot customization, allowing users to create highly customized visualizations.
Matplotlib is well-suited for creating basic plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

Seaborn:

Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.
It focuses on creating attractive and informative statistical visualizations with minimal code.
Seaborn includes several built-in themes and color palettes that enhance the visual aesthetics of plots.
It specializes in creating plots for statistical analysis, such as distribution plots, regression plots, and categorical plots.

Bokeh is a library for creating interactive visualizations that are suitable for web-based applications.
It allows for the creation of interactive plots with panning, zooming, and tooltips, making it ideal for exploring large datasets.
Bokeh supports both server-based and standalone visualizations and can be integrated with Flask or Django web frameworks.

Question 2:Relational Plots:

scatterplot(): Creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables. It displays each data point as a marker on the plot.
lineplot(): Creates a line plot to show the relationship between two numeric variables. It connects the data points with lines, making it useful for displaying trends over time or continuous variables.
Example use case: Visualizing the correlation between a student's study hours and their exam scores using a scatter plot or tracking the stock prices of a company over time using a line plot.
Categorical Plots:

barplot(): Displays the average value of a numeric variable for different categories using vertical or horizontal bars. It provides an estimate of central tendency and confidence intervals.
countplot(): Shows the count of observations in each category using bars. It is useful for visualizing the distribution of categorical variables.
Example use case: Comparing the average ratings of different restaurants by cuisine type using a bar plot or displaying the number of cars belonging to each brand using a count plot.
Distribution Plots:

histplot(): Creates a histogram to represent the distribution of a single numeric variable. It divides the data into bins and shows the frequency or density of observations within each bin.
kdeplot(): Displays the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot to estimate the probability density function of a variable. It provides a smoothed representation of the distribution.


Question3:
Quick Reference: The cheat sheet provides a concise summary of various Seaborn functions, allowing developers to quickly find the function they need without searching through the documentation. It serves as a handy reference tool when you need a reminder of the available functionalities.

Function Categories: The cheat sheet organizes Seaborn functions into different categories, such as Relational, Categorical, Distribution, and Regression plots. This categorization makes it easier for developers to locate specific types of plots based on their analysis needs.

Function Syntax and Parameters: The cheat sheet includes the syntax and parameters for each Seaborn function, providing a clear understanding of how to use the function and what options are available for customization. It helps developers quickly grasp the required inputs and optional parameters for creating different types of plots.
